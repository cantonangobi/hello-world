# hello-world
this is my first repository
I don't really know what i am doing
I am but a fragment of the dark wandering these transient lands of lords in search of something, what exactly? I don't know, the truth maybe, the Logos.
I wander from place to place but eventually always go back to the dark, for that is my fate.
I don't know what forces drive me, and I'm not sure that I even care
Fear not the dark my friend, for it is from the primordial abyss that all things are given life...and death
